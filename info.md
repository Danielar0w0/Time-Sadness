# Guidelines for writing the project report Time Series 2024 â€“ 2025
## 1. Introduction:

- Contextualization and purpose of the work, brief description of the methodology
used.

## 2. Data and exploratory analysis/data transformation

## 3. Model proposals (SARIMA type and/or ETS model and/or GARCH model):

- Box & Jenkins methodology if SARIMA models; thisincludes model identification,
parameter estimation, diagnostic evaluation (parameters correlation,
parameters significance, residual analysis).

## 4. Future observations forecast:

- Includes the analysis of its accuracy, confidence intervals (if possible), use of
bootstrap methodology (if necessary). Accuracy of the forecasts should be
compared.

## 5. Results, discussion/conclusions:

- Discussion should include the model choice.

## 6. References

## 7. Appendix:
- Auxiliary/not so important results are included in the Appendix.

## Note

These are some guidelines - it is not an exhaustive list, but it contains what is most
important. It can be organized in other way, if more suitable.
Do not forget: you should analyze all your data to model the particular model classes
that are suitable to the data trajectory behavior, then you have to split the data into a
training set (for model purposes) and a test set (for forecast purposes).
Deadline: Report and the correspondent script should be sent by the 16th of June 2025.
Presentation: On the 18th of June 2025 (Final Exam day).
