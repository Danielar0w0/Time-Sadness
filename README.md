# Time Series Modeling of Programming Technology Trends

This project focuses on modeling and forecasting the popularity of various programming technologies over time using time series analysis techniques.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of monthly data from January 2009 to December 2019. Each row represents a month, and each column corresponds to a specific technology or library (e.g., `python`, `r`, `matlab`, `nltk`, etc.). The values indicate the number of questions asked on Stack Overflow for each technology during that month.

- **Source**: [StackIndex Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aishu200023/stackindex)
- **Time Span**: 132 months (Jan 2009 â€“ Dec 2019)
- **Format**: CSV
- **Frequency**: Monthly
- **Variables**: 82 technologies/libraries

## Objective

To model and forecast the popularity of selected programming technologies using:

- SARIMA models (Box & Jenkins methodology)
- ...

The analysis includes model identification, parameter estimation, diagnostic checking, and forecasting.
